# Fixes Applied - Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Supabase "No API key found in request" Error ✅

**Problem:** Supabase requests were failing with "No API key found in request" error.

**Root Cause:** The custom fetch function in `lib/supabase.ts` was overriding headers incorrectly, preventing Supabase from adding its authentication headers.

**Solution:** Removed the custom fetch wrapper and let Supabase handle authentication headers automatically.

**File Changed:** `lib/supabase.ts`

### 2. tRPC "Network request failed" / 404 Error ✅

**Problem:** tRPC requests were returning 404 errors even though the backend was running.

**Root Cause:** The Hono tRPC middleware was mounted at `/api/trpc` but needed to be mounted at `/api/trpc/*` to properly catch all tRPC requests including batched queries.

**Solution:** Updated the tRPC middleware mount points to use wildcard paths:
- Changed `/api/trpc` to `/api/trpc/*`
- Changed `/trpc` to `/trpc/*`
- Removed the `endpoint` parameter which was causing conflicts

**File Changed:** `backend/hono.ts`

## How to Start the Backend

The backend needs to be running for the app to work properly. Here's how to start it:

### Option 1: Using the working script
```bash
node start-backend-working.js
```

### Option 2: Using Bun directly
```bash
cd /home/user/rork-app
bun backend/hono.ts
```

### Option 3: Start on a specific port
```bash
PORT=3001 bun backend/hono.ts
```

## Verify the Fixes

### 1. Check Backend Health
```bash
curl http://localhost:3001/
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "message": "Backend is running",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-12T...",
  "version": "1.0.0"
}
```

### 2. Test tRPC Connection
```bash
node test-trpc-connection-simple.js
```

Expected output:
```
✅ Basic health check successful
✅ tRPC router test successful
✅ tRPC health check successful
```

### 3. Check Supabase Connection
Open the app and try to:
- Sign in / Sign up
- View chats
- Send messages

All Supabase operations should now work without "No API key found" errors.

## What Should Work Now

1. ✅ Supabase authentication (sign in/sign up)
2. ✅ Supabase database queries (chats, messages, profiles)
3. ✅ tRPC health checks
4. ✅ tRPC procedures (chat.getChats, chat.sendMessage, etc.)
5. ✅ Backend API endpoints

## Troubleshooting

### If tRPC still fails:

1. **Make sure backend is running:**
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:3001/
   ```

2. **Check if port 3001 is in use:**
   ```bash
   lsof -i :3001
   ```

3. **Kill any existing backend processes:**
   ```bash
   pkill -f "bun.*hono"
   ```

4. **Restart the backend:**
   ```bash
   node start-backend-working.js
   ```

### If Supabase still fails:

1. **Check environment variables:**
   ```bash
   cat .env.local
   ```
   
   Should contain:
   ```
   EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://ypumvyhwtpscevoqgcat.supabase.co
   EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
   ```

2. **Verify Supabase project is active:**
   - Go to https://supabase.com/dashboard
   - Check if the project is paused
   - If paused, unpause it

3. **Clear app cache and restart:**
   - Stop the app
   - Clear Metro bundler cache: `rm -rf .expo`
   - Restart: `npm start`

## Next Steps

1. Start the backend using one of the methods above
2. Start the Expo app: `npm start`
3. Test the app functionality:
   - Sign in/Sign up
   - View chats
   - Send messages
   - Make calls

All features should now work correctly!
