# tRPC Connection Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **tRPC URL Path Mismatch**
- **Problem**: Backend was looking for procedures at paths like `trpc/health` but client was using `/api/trpc/*`
- **Solution**: Updated client to use `/trpc/*` endpoints (legacy) which work correctly

### 2. **Backend Startup Issues**
- **Problem**: Multiple backend startup scripts with inconsistent configurations
- **Solution**: Created clean startup script `start-backend-simple-final.js` with proper port management

### 3. **tRPC Client Configuration**
- **Problem**: Client was using `/api/trpc` but backend logs showed `/trpc` was working
- **Solution**: Updated `lib/trpc.ts` to use `/trpc` endpoints for compatibility

### 4. **Environment Configuration**
- **Problem**: Inconsistent port configuration between backend and client
- **Solution**: Standardized on port 3001 with proper `.env.local` updates

## Files Modified

### 1. `backend/hono.ts`
- Removed `endpoint` parameter from tRPC server configuration
- This allows Hono to handle routing correctly

### 2. `lib/trpc.ts`
- Changed tRPC client URL from `/api/trpc` to `/trpc`
- Updated all references to use legacy endpoints

### 3. `start-backend-simple-final.js`
- Clean backend startup with proper process cleanup
- Automatic port detection and `.env.local` updates

### 4. `test-trpc-simple-final.js`
- Comprehensive test script for both backend and tRPC endpoints
- Tests both legacy and primary endpoints

### 5. `start-and-test-backend-final.js`
- Combined startup and testing script
- Provides immediate feedback on connection status

## How to Use

### Start Backend
```bash
node start-backend-simple-final.js
```

### Test Connection
```bash
node test-trpc-simple-final.js
```

### Start and Test (Recommended)
```bash
node start-and-test-backend-final.js
```

## Expected Output

When working correctly, you should see:
- ✅ Backend Health - SUCCESS
- ✅ tRPC Health - SUCCESS  
- ✅ tRPC Ping - SUCCESS

## URLs

- **Backend Health**: http://localhost:3001/
- **tRPC Health**: http://localhost:3001/trpc/health
- **tRPC Ping**: http://localhost:3001/trpc/ping

## Key Changes Made

1. **Removed endpoint parameter** from tRPC server configuration in `backend/hono.ts`
2. **Switched to legacy `/trpc` endpoints** in client configuration
3. **Standardized on port 3001** across all configurations
4. **Added comprehensive error handling** and logging
5. **Created clean startup scripts** with proper process management

## Why This Works

The backend was correctly serving tRPC endpoints at both `/api/trpc/*` and `/trpc/*`, but the client configuration was causing routing issues. By using the `/trpc/*` endpoints (which the backend logs showed were working), we avoid the routing conflicts and establish a stable connection.

The key insight was that the backend error logs showed "No procedure found on path 'trpc/health'" - this indicated the tRPC server was receiving requests but couldn't find the procedures due to path resolution issues. Using the legacy endpoints resolves this problem.
