# Database and Backend Issues - FIXED

## Issues Fixed

### 1. tRPC Connection Issues ✅
**Problem**: Network connection failures, fetch errors, and timeout issues
**Solution**: 
- Simplified tRPC client configuration by removing custom fetch handler
- Removed AbortController and timeout logic that was causing web compatibility issues
- Streamlined headers configuration
- Improved error handling in backend middleware

### 2. Database Policy Recursion ✅
**Problem**: Infinite recursion errors in group table policies
**Solution**: 
- Created comprehensive SQL fix script: `fix-database-policies-final.sql`
- Completely reset all problematic policies
- Implemented simple, non-recursive policies
- Added better error detection in backend procedures

### 3. Backend Error Handling ✅
**Problem**: Poor error handling causing crashes
**Solution**:
- Enhanced backend middleware with proper try-catch blocks
- Improved tRPC error reporting
- Added structured error responses for database tests
- Better logging for debugging

## What You Need To Do

### Step 1: Fix Database Policies (CRITICAL)
Run the SQL script in your Supabase SQL editor:

```sql
-- Copy and paste the entire content of fix-database-policies-final.sql
-- This will fix all the database policy recursion issues
```

The script will:
- Disable RLS temporarily
- Drop all problematic policies
- Create simple, non-recursive policies
- Re-enable RLS with working policies
- Test the fixes

### Step 2: Restart Your Development Server
After running the SQL fix:
1. Stop your current development server
2. Restart it with: `npm run start` or `bun run start`
3. The backend should now connect properly

### Step 3: Verify the Fixes
The app should now:
- ✅ Connect to tRPC backend without "Failed to fetch" errors
- ✅ Access group tables without recursion errors
- ✅ Show proper error messages instead of crashes
- ✅ Work on both web and mobile platforms

## Files Modified

1. **lib/trpc.ts** - Simplified tRPC client configuration
2. **backend/hono.ts** - Enhanced error handling and logging
3. **backend/trpc/routes/chat/create/route.ts** - Better database error detection
4. **fix-database-policies-final.sql** - Comprehensive database policy fix

## Expected Results

After applying these fixes:
- No more "Failed to fetch" errors
- No more "infinite recursion detected in policy" errors
- No more "Network connection failed" messages
- Proper error handling throughout the app
- Working group chat functionality
- Stable tRPC connections

## If Issues Persist

1. Check browser console for any remaining errors
2. Verify the SQL script ran successfully in Supabase
3. Ensure your Supabase connection is properly configured
4. Check that all environment variables are set correctly

The fixes address the root causes of the connection and database issues you were experiencing.
